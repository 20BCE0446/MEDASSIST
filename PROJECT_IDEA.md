ABOUT TEAM:  

This is a 4 membered all-girls team. Each member of this team is in their first year from VIT UNIVERSITY, VELLORE CAMPUS, with knowledge of HTML, CSS, PYTHON AND C PROGRAMMING.   

ABOUT THE IDEA:

Our idea is to build a web-based application that can help people during medical emergencies. With the AI-based disease prediction system, the application will be able to determine the possible health risk from the observed symptoms and the level of risk. The application will also direct the user about the medical assistance that is required to deal with that particular emergency. Our application will find the nearest possible healthcare centres for the user. The one-click emergency feature will help the user to call the ambulance immediately by sharing the user’s live location and the details about the symptoms and predicted health risks. The application will also send emergency messages to the user’s family members/emergency contacts.

OBJECTIVES:

The main objective of our idea is to make the health care system more effective in cases of medical emergencies. According to a statistical report by the Indian government, it was found that the rate of preventable deaths was 25.8% with delayed diagnosis and inappropriate medical management as its reasons. 
1)	With the help of AI diagnosis of symptoms in our application, the rate of diagnosis will be faster and better, and the doctors can know where immediate treatment is required. 
2)	With the live location sharing feature, we are trying to make it easier for the ambulance to reach the patient’s location on time.
3)	Through the emergency contact feature, our objective is to enhance the communication between the patient and his/her family members during a medical emergency.

FEATURES:

1)	Login/signup feature: the user will be able to create his/her account and store the details about any prior health condition or disease that he/she has been diagnosed with, past and present medications
2)	Emergency contacts feature: lets the user store the contact details of as many members he/she wants to 
3)	AI disease/health risk prediction from the observed symptoms: this will predict the health condition of the person and generate a report of the risk level and immediate first-aid that should be taken
4)	The map feature will list out the user’s current location and show all the nearest healthcare centres 
5)	Emergency feature: This will send the user’s live location, the symptom’s details and predicted health condition report to the health care centre and call for an ambulance

GOOD TO HAVE FEATURE:

1)	All information’s and details in the user’s profile will be secure and confidential
2)	There will be an option for the user to choose who the patient is and accordingly the diagnosis report will be sent to the respective patient’s emergency contacts.
3)	Detecting the real-time location of the user and identifying the nearest possible health care centre.
4)	Providing detailed diagnosis of the symptoms with health risk chart and risk level indicator and proper steps of first-aid that can keep the situation under control till the ambulance arrived

IMPLEMENTATION

During the Hackathon, we will focus on implementing a prototype of our project where it will detect a medical emergency condition from its symptoms. We will try to completely implement the emergency feature and live location sharing feature of our project during the campaign hour. We will also try our best to cover up all the important features of our application as far as possible.


FINAL RESULT:

The fully functional project will be implemented in both websites as well as the mobile application form. It will be able to diagnose the symptoms accurately give the results in both textual and graphical form to make it easier for the user as well as medical professionals to understand. The one-click emergency call will help in getting the location of the nearest ambulance and the live location sharing features will help the ambulance to reach the patients more accurately.
